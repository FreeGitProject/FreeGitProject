### 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer with **3+ years of experience** building robust, scalable applications using **.NET Core**, **Dapper**, **CQRS**, **MediatR**, and **Clean Architecture**.  

I've worked on both **product-based** and **service-based** solutions — most notably contributing to a **PIM (Product Information Management)** and **OMS (Order Management System)** for an e-commerce platform at **XYZ Company**.

In my free time, I love crafting full-stack side projects from scratch — from backend to frontend, database to deployment.
